——Installation
Extract the `Netronic` directories to either:

  yourself: `~/.local/share/themes`, or
  everyone: `/usr/local/share/themes`.

Netronic should then be available.

The `wine` directory contains registry files for importing.


——Firefox
You can use your preferred GTK3 theme in Firefox:

1. Set `widget.non-native-theme.enabled` to false to disable the built-in theme.
2. Set `widget.content.gtk-theme-override` to its name.
3. Restart Firefox for these to take effect.


——Wine
Netronic works best with no theme. Either set this at `winecfg`, or import
`winecfg-notheme.reg`, before importing your preferred `Netronic` registry file.

You may need to restart `wineserver` for these to take effect.


——Troubleshooting
If you extracted the `Netronic` directories elsewhere and an application is not
themed right, ensure that it can and may read there; check its AppArmor profile.
