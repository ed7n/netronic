Netronic Setup Manual by Brendon, 04/10/2023.

For the latest version, see [https://ed7n.github.io/netronic/setup].


——Installation

————GTK / Complete
Extract the `themes` directory to either yourself: `~/.local/share`, or
everyone: `/usr/local/share`.


————GTK / Individual
Extract your preferred themes from the `themes` directory to either yourself:
`~/.local/share/themes`, or everyone: `/usr/local/share/themes`.


————Qt 5
The `qt5ct/colors` directory contains palette files for use with the Qt5
Configuration Tool (qt5ct). Extract it to either yourself: `~/.config/qt5ct`, or
everyone: `/usr/share/qt5ct`.

If you installed qt5ct during this user session, you may have to relogin for
changes to start taking effect. It should inform you when to do this to set
`QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct`.


————Wine
The `wine` directory contains registry files for importing.

You may want to disable theming--either in `winecfg`, or import
`wine/winecfg-notheme.reg`--before importing your preferred `Netronic` registry
file.

Alternatively, Wine staging users may try the GTK theming feature.

You may need to restart `wineserver` for these to take effect.


——Firefox
The built-in theme can not be completely disabled. See Mozilla bug 1749645 for
a discussion.

Otherwise, you can use your preferred GTK 3 theme colors in Firefox:

1. Set `widget.non-native-theme.enabled` to `false` to disable the built-in
theme.
2. Set `widget.content.gtk-theme-override` to its name.
3. Restart Firefox for these to take effect.
4. Set `privacy.resistFingerprinting` to `false`. This may break your privacy.

If the GTK colors on the scrollbar are unfit, then you can disable this by
setting `widget.gtk.theme-scrollbar-colors.enabled` to `false`.


——Troubleshooting

————Notice
Xfce 4.18 resolved some significant issues with Handy and GTK 4, and we followed
it with initial support. So if you have issues with either, update both Xfce and
Netronic first.


————Specific Troubleshooting
If you extracted the theme files elsewhere and an application is not themed
right, then ensure that it can and may read there; check its AppArmor profile.
Some applications look only in `/usr/share/themes`, where system-managed themes
are installed. Installing Netronic there should be fine.

If a Handy application follows your dark color scheme but not the theme
altogether, then either rename the theme or make a symbolic link to it, as long
as its name does not end with "-dark". This workaround foregoes system-wide
"dark mode."

If you see any odd magenta-colored widgets, then you have discovered one of our
placeholders for the unknowns; please let us know about them.
