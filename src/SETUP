Netronic Setup Manual by Brendon, 03/23/2023.

For the latest version, see [https://ed7n.github.io/netronic/setup].


——Installation

————GTK3 / Complete
Extract the `themes` directory to either yourself: `~/.local/share`, or
everyone: `/usr/local/share`.


————GTK3 / Individual
Extract your preferred themes from the `themes` directory to either yourself:
`~/.local/share/themes`, or everyone: `/usr/local/share/themes`.


————Qt5
The `qt5ct/colors` directory contains palette files for use with the Qt5
Configuration Tool (qt5ct). Extract it to either yourself: `~/.config/qt5ct`, or
everyone: `/usr/share/qt5ct`.

If you installed qt5ct during this user session, you may have to relogin for
changes to start taking effect. It should inform you when to do this to set
`QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct`.


————Wine
The `wine` directory contains registry files for importing.

You may want to disable theming--either in `winecfg`, or import
`wine/winecfg-notheme.reg`--before importing your preferred `Netronic` registry
file.

Alternatively, Wine staging users may try the GTK theming feature.

You may need to restart `wineserver` for these to take effect.


——Firefox
The built-in theme can not be completely disabled.

Otherwise, you can use your preferred GTK 3 theme colors in Firefox:

1. Set `widget.non-native-theme.enabled` to `false` to disable the built-in
theme.
2. Set `widget.content.gtk-theme-override` to its name.
3. Restart Firefox for these to take effect.
4. Set `privacy.resistFingerprinting` to `false`. This may break your privacy.

If the GTK colors on the scrollbar are unfit, then you can disable this by
setting `widget.gtk.theme-scrollbar-colors.enabled` to `false`.


——Troubleshooting

————Notice
The ongoing mix of GTK 3 and 4 has brought issues into Netronic. A way to avoid
them is not to use graphical applications and resources for GNOME until both
Xfce and Netronic resolve the discrepancies.


————Specific Troubleshooting

If you extracted the theme files elsewhere and an application is not themed
right, then ensure that it can and may read there; check its AppArmor profile.
Some applications look only in `/usr/share/themes`, where system-managed themes
are installed. Installing Netronic there should be fine.

If a GTK Handy application follows only your dark color scheme and not the theme
altogether, then use its "darken" alternative. This may break automatic color
scheme detection.

If a GTK 4 application does not use your preferred theme, then it is expected
that way. libadwaita uses its own theming infrastructure different from that for
GTK 3. We are likely to follow Xfce's decision on libadwaita.

If icons are not sized or spaced correctly, then you are likely to be using
version 43 of the Adwaita icon theme. For now, we suggest downgrading to version
42 at most and lock it there.

If you see any odd magenta-colored widgets, then you have discovered one of our
placeholders for the unknowns; please let us know about them.
