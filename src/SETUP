Netronic Setup Manual by Brendon, 07/25/2022.

——Installation

————GTK3 / Complete
Extract the `themes` directory to either yourself: `~/.local/share`, or
everyone: `/usr/local/share`.


————GTK3 / Individual
Extract your preferred themes from the `themes` directory to either yourself:
`~/.local/share/themes`, or everyone: `/usr/local/share/themes`.


————Qt5
The `qt5ct/colors` directory contains palette files for use with the Qt5
Configuration Tool (qt5ct). Extract it to either yourself: `~/.config/qt5ct`, or
everyone: `/usr/share/qt5ct`.

If you installed qt5ct during this user session, you may have to relogin for
changes to start taking effect. The application should inform you on an
environment variable.


————Wine
The `wine` directory contains registry files for importing.

You may want to disable theming--either in `winecfg`, or import
`wine/winecfg-notheme.reg`--before importing your preferred `Netronic` registry
file.

Alternatively, Wine staging users may try the GTK theming feature.

You may need to restart `wineserver` for these to take effect.


——Firefox
You can use your preferred GTK3 theme in Firefox:

1. Set `widget.non-native-theme.enabled` to false to disable the built-in theme.
2. Set `widget.content.gtk-theme-override` to its name.
3. Restart Firefox for these to take effect.


——Troubleshooting
If you extracted the `Netronic` directories elsewhere and an application is not
themed right, ensure that it can and may read there; check its AppArmor profile.

If you see any odd magenta-colored widgets, you have discovered one of our
placeholders for the unknowns; please let us know about them.
