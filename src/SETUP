——Installation
Extract the `Netronic` directories to either:

  yourself: `~/.local/share/themes`, or
  everyone: `/usr/local/share/themes`.

Netronic should then be available.

The `wine` directory contains registry files for importing.


————Qt5
The `qt5ct/colors` directory contains palette files for use with the Qt5
Configuration Tool (qt5ct). Extract it to either:

  yourself: `~/.config/qt5ct`, or
  everyone: `/usr/share/qt5ct`.

Netronic should then be available.

If you installed qt5ct during this user session, you may want to relogin for
changes to start taking effect. The application should inform you on an
environment variable.


——Firefox
You can use your preferred GTK3 theme in Firefox:

1. Set `widget.non-native-theme.enabled` to false to disable the built-in theme.
2. Set `widget.content.gtk-theme-override` to its name.
3. Restart Firefox for these to take effect.


——Wine
Netronic works best with no theme. Either set this at `winecfg`, or import
`wine/winecfg-notheme.reg`, before importing your preferred `Netronic` registry
file.

You may need to restart `wineserver` for these to take effect.


——Troubleshooting
If you extracted the `Netronic` directories elsewhere and an application is not
themed right, ensure that it can and may read there; check its AppArmor profile.

If you see any odd magenta-colored widgets, you have discovered one of my
placeholders for the unknowns; please let me know about them.
