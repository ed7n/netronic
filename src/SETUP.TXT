——Installation
Copy the `Netronic` directories to either:

  yourself: `~/.local/share/themes`, or
  everyone: `/usr/local/share/themes`.

Netronic should then be available.

The `wine` directory contains registry files for importing.


——Firefox
To use your preferred GTK3 theme in Firefox, set
`widget.content.gtk-theme-override` to its name. You may need to restart Firefox
for this to take effect.
